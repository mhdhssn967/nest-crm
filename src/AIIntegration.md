# ðŸ“„ AI Chatbot for Admin â€“ Requirement Documentation

## Overview  
The CRM application allows employees to add, view, and update potential client details. Administrators have access to all client records. As the volume of data increases, manually navigating through entries becomes inefficient. To address this, an AI-powered chatbot is integrated exclusively for admin users. This assistant enables natural language interaction with the CRM data, streamlining access to critical information.

## Objective  
Enable the admin to interact with client data through a conversational interface. The chatbot interprets natural language queries and returns relevant data or summaries without the need for manual searching or filtering.

## Key Features  
- Admin-only chatbot interface integrated into the dashboard  
- Natural language understanding to interpret admin queries  
- Dynamic querying and filtering of client records from Firebase  
- Summarized and structured responses, generated using AI  
- Handles queries such as:  
  - "Which clients havenâ€™t been followed up recently?"  
  - "List potential clients added in the last 7 days."  
  - "Show leads with CEO as the point of contact."  
  - "How many leads were added by [employee name]?"

## Purpose  
The chatbot improves the CRM's usability by reducing manual workload for administrators. It provides faster access to insights, enhances data visibility, and supports more informed decision-making. The system remains flexible for use across various sectors, including healthcare, marketing, and sales.
